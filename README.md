# darkville
Darkville is a game where the players find themselves in a small village.
There is one problem with this village: some of the villagers are werewolves during the night.
Those werewolves will eat one of the innocent villagers each night.
To prevent this the citizens of Darkville have decided to hold a voting for
who they think are the werewolves.
The villager that got elected will be lynched, hoping that this villager was a werewolf.

Darkville is a plugin for the app Happening (http://happening.im/).
The users can set up a game for their group.
In this game the players can vote each day who they want to kill and the
werewolves can vote each night who they want to kill.
When all the werewolves are dead, then the villagers have won the game.
When there are only werewolves left, then the werewolves have won.
